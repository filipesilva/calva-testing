# Testing with Shadow CLJS and Calva

## Using node-repl

- `yarn shadow-cljs node-repl`
- `(require 'app.core-spec)`
- `(cljs.test/run-tests 'app.core-spec)`

Pros:
- needs only node-repl
- can selectively run tests

Cons:
- namespace needs to be reloaded manually
- node-repl isn't as nice as the Calva repl window (command repeat, autocomplete, etc)
- no editor intellisense
- can't use Calva repl because there's no application connected to the repl


## Using a node-test build with autorun

- `yarn shadow-cljs watch test`

Pros:
- needs only shadow-cljs
- all tests run on save

Cons:
- can't selectively run tests
- no editor intellisense
- can't use Calva repl because there's no application connected to the repl


## Using jack in on a node-test build with autorun

- ctrl+shift+p jack in
- select `test` build
- select `test` as build to connect to

Pros:
- editor intellisense
- all tests run on save

Cons:
- can't selectively run tests
- can't use Calva repl because there's no application connected to the repl
- ctrl+shift+p `Calva: run all tests` doesn't work (probably https://github.com/BetterThanTomorrow/calva/issues/311)
```
Evaluating file: core_spec.cljs
No application has connected to the REPL server. Make sure your JS environment has loaded your compiled ClojureScript code.

No results from file evaluation.
Running namespace testsâ€¦

## Using jack in on a node-test build with autorun, but connecting to node-repl

- ctrl+shift+p jack in
- select `test` build
- select `node-repl` as build to connect to

Pros:
- editor intellisense
- all tests run on save
- can use Calva repl
- can selectively run tests on Calva repl

Cons:
- ctrl+shift+p `Calva: run all tests` doesn't work (same as above)
- must manually refresh namespace with ctrl+shift+p "Calva: load current namespace in repl" (or turn on "run load-file on save" option)
- running tests by name in Calva repl shows nil return, must check separate calva output pane (probably https://github.com/thheller/shadow-cljs/issues/373)
```
(Calva repl)
app.core-spec=> (my-test)
nil
```
```
(Calva output pane)
<cljs-repl#5>
FAIL in (my-test) (at d:475:6)
This test should fail
<cljs-repl#5>expected: (= 1 4)
  actual: (not (= 1 4))
```

## Using jack in on a node-test build without autorun, but connecting to node-repl

Same as above, but removing the autorun is better when tests are slow.

Run individual tests in calva repl by name `(my-test)`.
Run all tests via `(cljs.test/run-tests 'app.core-spec)`.

Cons:
- trying to load the namespace on calva repl shows error on output pane (https://github.com/thheller/shadow-cljs/issues/587)
